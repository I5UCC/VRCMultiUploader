Do you have a ***multitude of different versions of an avatar?***<br> 
And with every little change you make you need to ***reupload every single version manually again***, just to apply that change? <br>
***Then this tool is for you!***

VRCMultiUploader is a tool designed to streamline the process of uploading multiple VRChat avatars automatically, saving you time!

# Usage

VRCMultiUploader is a tool that allows you to ***upload all active GameObjects with a Pipeline Manager***. <br>
However, it will display an error if the Pipeline Manager is empty. To avoid this, ensure that you ***set up the Avatar at least once manually***.

To use VRCMultiUploader, follow these steps:
1. In the ***Unity Menu Bar***, locate and select `VRCMultiUploader`.
2. Select either `Build and Publish` or `Build and Test`, depending on your requirements.
3. Profit??
